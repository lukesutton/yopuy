# Yopuy

An experiment with a simple wrapper for accessing JSON/REST web APIs. Inspired by [an episode](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E01-networking) of Swift Talk.

This library differs in that it allows for nesting of resources — in a type safe manner — with some nice operators to aid in the composition of resources.

Since this is a sketch, there are no tests, no documentation and no introduction. Soz.
